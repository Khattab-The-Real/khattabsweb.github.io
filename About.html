            <p class="dark">I am Khattab, and I am a 13 year old programmer (at the moment) and I have a YouTube channel with about 70 subscribers, not big but hey it is a start for a 13 year old. I decided to join the Programming community because it felt nice to have more skills added to me, and to also help me i nthe future as I am planning to be a Computer scientists. I had also made a channel all about Programming things that currently does not have much videos, but if you want to follow it Click the button that says "YouTube" so it can take you to my youtube channel!</p>
            <p class="dark">I hope everyone will enjoy the content I make and get use out of it. Have a good day/afternoon/night or whatever time it is for you!</p>
